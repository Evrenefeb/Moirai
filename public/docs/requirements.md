## 1\. Introduction

### 1\.1 Purpose

This document defines the functional and non\-functional requirements of the system\.

### 1\.2 Target Users

- Students
- Professionals
- Individuals making complex decisions

## 2\. Functional Requirements

FR\-01: The system shall allow users to create a new decision\.

FR\-02: The system shall allow users to define multiple criteria for each decision\.

FR\-03: The system shall allow users to assign a weight \(1–10\) to each criterion\.

FR\-04: The system shall allow users to add multiple alternatives\.

FR\-05: The system shall allow users to assign scores \(1–10\) for each alternative per criterion\.

FR\-06: The system shall calculate weighted scores automatically\.

FR\-07: The system shall rank alternatives based on total scores\.

FR\-08: The system shall calculate decision stability\.

FR\-09: The system shall allow editing and deletion of decisions\.

FR\-10: The system shall validate user inputs\.

FR\-11: The system shall display analysis results in modern and understandable charts\.

FR\-12: The system shall generate a textual summary about the final decision\.

## 3\. Non\-Functional Requirements

NFR\-01: The system shall respond within 200ms for user interactions\.

NFR\-02: The system shall support at least 10 criteria per decision\.

NFR\-03: The system shall support at least 13 alternatives per decision\.

NFR\-04: The system shall not transmit user data to external servers\.
